Counselor-Client matchmaking application that allows clients to filter for a counselor that fulfills their criteria. It is built using a React frontend, NodeJS backend, and a no-sql Mongodb database. Features include geographic based matching using Leaflet, and a full administrator interface to add, create, and modify: user information, available filtering properties, and activate/deactivate counselor profiles.
